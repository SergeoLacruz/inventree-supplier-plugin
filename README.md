# inventree-supplier-plugin

This is a scheduled task plugin for [InvenTree](https://inventree.org), which gets data from a
supplier like Mouser and puts it into the Inventree Database. 
It is work in progress. A lot of things need to be done. 
Error handling is very basic. 

## Installation

There is no package yet. Just copy the code into src/Inventree/plugins
